        It would definitely be very helpful, and essential to get a realistic <a href="https://purplefacts.com/blog/how-to-estimate-repair-cost">repair cost estimate</a>, to get a better image of the property conditions. If you could forward me any pictures or videos of the property, I'd really appreciate it. If it turns out to be too much for an email attachement please let me know, and I'll setup a cloud folder where you'll be able to securely drop any images and videos you have.&nbsp;
